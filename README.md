# sev4fire-QGIS-plugin
sev4fire is a plugin for QGIS that returns a vector file of the fire classified by severity and a graph with the total burned hectares according to severity defined by USGS. Copernicus images must be used for this plugin.
This plugin is explained in my Master's Final Project for the Geotechnologies and GIS Project Development program at the University of Oviedo.
Additionally, a manual in Spanish is provided on how to use the plugin.
